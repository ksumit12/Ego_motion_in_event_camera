\chapter{Sensitivity Analysis of Parameters}\label{chap:metrics}

\section{Effect of Prediction Horizon \(\Delta t\)}
Plot cancellation ratio vs. \(\Delta t\) (e.g., 0.25â€“4 ms); explain phase misalignment growth.

\section{Spatial Tolerance (pixels)}
Trade-off between true matches and false positives as the radius increases.

\section{Temporal Tolerance (ms)}
Impact of timestamp jitter and sensor timing; interaction with \(\Delta t\).

\section{Polarity Handling}
Compare with/without polarity; discuss asymmetric thresholds.

\section{Angular Velocity Bias}
Sweep constant bias in \(\omega\); quantify sensitivity and linearity range.

\section{Residuals vs. Background Baseline}
Compute events/area in background vs. disc residuals; interpret SNR-like improvement.

\section{Summary of Trends}
Bullet the most actionable parameter settings and caveats.
