\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}

This chapter presents quantitative and qualitative results on the spinning-disc dataset (Chapter~\ref{chap:setup}). We evaluate cancellation across prediction horizon $\Delta t$, spatial tolerance $\epsilon_{xy}$, and temporal tolerance $\epsilon_t$, and analyze residual distributions to understand where cancellation succeeds or fails.

\section{Overall Cancellation Performance}

Figure~\ref{fig:cancellation_vs_dt} shows the primary result: cancellation rate as a function of prediction horizon $\Delta t$ for optimal spatial and temporal tolerances ($\epsilon_{xy}=2.0$\,px, $\epsilon_t=5.0$\,ms). The data from three independent 10\,ms windows exhibit a clear exponential decay trend with increasing $\Delta t$, consistent with the phase-error accumulation model derived in Chapter~\ref{chap:problem}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{images/results_figures/windows_dt_sweep.png}
\caption{Cancellation vs prediction horizon across three 10\,ms windows, showing consistent exponential decay: high CR ($>95\%$) at short horizons ($\Delta t \leq 1$\,ms), smooth decline, and baseline ($\sim 32\%$) at long horizons. Tight overlap (s.d. $<2\%$) indicates temporal robustness. Parameters: $\epsilon_{xy}=2.0$\,px, $\epsilon_t=5.0$\,ms; opposite-polarity matching in circular ROI ($r=250$\,px).}
  \label{fig:cancellation_vs_dt}
\end{figure}

At short horizons ($\Delta t < 2$\,ms), CR exceeds 90\%. As $\Delta t$ increases, phase mismatch (Eq.~\eqref{eq:angvel-error}) grows linearly, drifting predictions from true positions. CR drops to ~35\% at $\Delta t=6$\,ms and stabilizes near 20--25\% at longer horizons, indicating a baseline from non-overlapping edges and noise.

The exponential fit yields a characteristic timescale $\tau_{1/2} \approx 3.5$\,ms for 50\% cancellation, consistent with the angular velocity $\omega \approx 2$\,rad/s and spatial tolerance $\epsilon_{xy}=2$\,px through the relation $\epsilon_{xy} \approx r\,\omega\,\tau_{1/2}$ (Chapter~\ref{chap:problem}). This validates the theoretical phase-drift model and provides a concrete operating bound for the cancellation system.

\subsection{Fine-Resolution Analysis of Early Drop-off}

To identify the precise operating limit where cancellation transitions from excellent to moderate performance, we performed fine-resolution sampling of $\Delta t$ at 0.1\,ms intervals over the critical 0--3\,ms range. Figure~\ref{fig:fine_dropoff} presents this detailed characterization using a representative 50,000-event sample from a 5-second window.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/results_figures/fine_resolution_dropoff.png}
\caption{Fine-resolution early drop-off. CR vs $\Delta t$ at 0.1\,ms resolution over 0--3\,ms. Dual axis shows predicted pixel displacement ($\omega=3.6$\,rad/s, mean radius $r\approx 199$\,px). CR remains $>99\%$ to 0.6\,ms, crosses 90\% at $\Delta t \approx 2.2$\,ms ($\sim 1.6$\,px), defining the recommended operating window. Smoothness validates continuous temporal gating. Sample: 50k events; $\epsilon_t=5.0$\,ms, $\epsilon_{xy}=2.0$\,px.
}
  \label{fig:fine_dropoff}
\end{figure}

The fine-resolution sweep reveals that performance remains above 95\% for $\Delta t \leq 1.0$\,ms (corresponding to $\sim 0.7$\,px displacement), then declines smoothly to 90\% at $\Delta t \approx 2.2$\,ms ($\sim 1.6$\,px) and continues to 81\% at 3\,ms. This precision identifies the critical transition zone obscured by coarser 1\,ms sampling and directly connects temporal horizons to geometric prediction error through the pixel-displacement axis.

\section{Parameter Sensitivity Analysis}

The cancellation rate depends on the choice of spatial and temporal tolerances, which control the trade-off between successful matches (true positives) and false matches (over-cancellation). Figure~\ref{fig:tolerance_heatmap} shows cancellation rate as a function of both tolerances for fixed $\Delta t=2.0$\,ms, revealing the operational parameter space.

% \begin{figure}[t]
%   \centering
%   \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{../code/thesis_figures/figure_tolerance_sensitivity.pdf}
%   \caption{Cancellation rate heatmaps for different prediction horizons: $\Delta t = 2$\,ms (left), $4$\,ms (center), and $6$\,ms (right). Color indicates cancellation rate from low (dark purple) to high (bright yellow). Annotation values show CR percentage. Optimal combinations lie at moderate tolerance values ($\epsilon_{xy} \approx 2--3$\,px, $\epsilon_t \approx 1--2$\,ms), balancing spatial mismatch with temporal uncertainty.}
%   \label{fig:tolerance_heatmap}
% \end{figure}

Several key trends emerge:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Spatial tolerance:} Cancellation rate increases rapidly with $\epsilon_{xy}$ up to $2--3$\,px, after which gains saturate. This indicates that most genuine matches lie within $2--3$\,px of predicted locations under accurate motion estimation. Larger tolerances ($\epsilon_{xy} \geq 5$\,px) inflate cancellation rates but risk over-matching unrelated events from different edge trajectories.
\item \textbf{Temporal tolerance:} Similar saturation occurs around $\epsilon_t \approx 1.0$\,ms. For smaller $\epsilon_t$, timestamp jitter and sensor latency variability cause missed matches. For larger $\epsilon_t$, temporal overlap with unrelated edge crossings from adjacent regions introduces false pairs.
\item \textbf{Horizon dependence:} As $\Delta t$ increases, higher tolerances are required to maintain the same cancellation rate, consistent with the growing phase error (\eqref{eq:angvel-error}). At $\Delta t=6$\,ms, even large tolerances ($\epsilon_{xy}=5$\,px) achieve only $\sim 40\%$ cancellation, confirming that phase drift dominates matching at long horizons.
\end{itemize}

% Table~\ref{tab:optimal_params} summarizes the top 10 parameter combinations achieving highest cancellation rates, showing that optimal performance occurs at $(\Delta t=1--2$\,ms, $\epsilon_{xy}=2--3$\,px, $\epsilon_t \approx 1$\,ms$)$.

\section{Spatial Distribution of Residuals}

To understand \emph{where} cancellation fails spatially, we first examine the predicted pixel displacement across the image plane. Figure~\ref{fig:flow_magnitude} shows flow magnitude maps for two representative prediction horizons, visualizing the radial dependence of geometric phase error.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{images/results_figures/flow_magnitude_maps.png}
\caption{Flow magnitude maps for $\Delta t=1.0$ and $3.0$\,ms. Displacement grows linearly with radius ($d=r\,\omega\,\Delta t$). At 1\,ms the rim displacement ($\sim 1$\,px) is within $\epsilon_{xy}=2$\,px; at 3\,ms it reaches $\sim 3$\,px, nearing/exceeding tolerance and degrading cancellation.}
  \label{fig:flow_magnitude}
\end{figure}

Cancellation effectiveness varies with radius due to three factors:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Event sparsity:} Near the center ($r < 50$\,px), event rate is low, reducing opportunities for matching and yielding low absolute cancellation counts despite high CR when events do occur.
\item \textbf{Phase error accumulation:} At large radii ($r > 250$\,px), the circumferential velocity $v_{\text{circ}} = r\,\omega$ is highest, amplifying phase errors $\varepsilon_{\omega}(r,\Delta t) \approx r\,|\Delta\omega|\,\Delta t$ per~\eqref{eq:angvel-error}. This causes systematic mismatch at the outer rim.
\item \textbf{Edge density:} Mid-radii ($r \approx 100--200$\,px) exhibit high event density (many edge crossings) and moderate velocities, creating optimal conditions for cancellation.
\end{enumerate}

The residual profile shows a characteristic ``donut'' pattern: high residual density near the rim and in the center, with low residuals in intermediate radii. This is consistent with the theoretical model (Chapter~\ref{chap:problem}) and provides a diagnostic for motion estimation bias: uniform radial residuals suggest $\Delta c$ error; widening with radius suggests $\Delta\omega$ error.

\section{Region-of-Interest Analysis}

We quantify cancellation efficiency separately inside and outside the circular ROI (the disc region). Table~\ref{tab:roi_comparison} shows that cancellation is highly effective \emph{inside} the ROI (CR $> 85\%$ for $\Delta t \leq 2$\,ms), where events are driven by predictable ego-motion, whereas \emph{outside} the ROI (background static scene), cancellation rates remain low (CR $\approx 10--15\%$), as expected since those events are not generated by the rotational motion model.

\begin{table}[t]
  \centering
  \caption{ROI cancellation performance comparison.}
  \label{tab:roi_comparison}
  \input{images/main_results/roi_table_window2_clean.tex}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{../code/thesis_figures/figure_roi_analysis.pdf}
\caption{ROI cancellation analysis. (a) CR inside vs outside the disc across horizons shows a large gap ($>70\%$ at short horizons), confirming targeting of ego-motion events. (b) The gap narrows at longer horizons as phase error dominates.}
  \label{fig:roi_comparison}
\end{figure}

This strong targeting validates the rotation-only motion model for the disc region. The efficiency gap (inside CR $-$ outside CR) exceeds 70\% at short horizons, confirming that the cancellation algorithm successfully distinguishes ego-motion events from background. As $\Delta t$ increases, the gap narrows, indicating that phase error affects both regions similarly once motion estimation degrades.

\section{Displacement Statistics}

For successful matches, we analyze the distribution of spatial displacements $\|x_j - x_i'\|_2$ between matched predicted and real events. Figure~\ref{fig:displacement} shows that the mean displacement across optimal parameter combinations is $\approx 0.8$\,px, with 95\% of matches within $1.5$\,px. This indicates that matching is tight under appropriate tolerance settings, validating the spatial gate design.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{../code/thesis_figures/figure_displacement_distribution.pdf}
\caption{Displacement distribution. (a) Histogram of mean displacements shows most configurations achieve $\langle \|x_j - x_i'\| \rangle < 2$\,px. (b) Fraction above thresholds (3, 5\,px); >95\% of matches lie within 3\,px, validating spatial tolerance design.}
  \label{fig:displacement}
\end{figure}

Only a small fraction ($< 5\%$) of matches exhibit displacements exceeding 3\,px, indicating that over-cancellation (matching unrelated edges) is rare at the chosen tolerances. This tight distribution is expected given the spatial gate $\epsilon_{xy} \leq 2--3$\,px enforces proximity constraints.

\section{Qualitative Visualisation}

Figure~\ref{fig:before_after} shows qualitative results for a representative time window ($t=5.0--5.01$\,s) under optimal parameters ($\Delta t=2$\,ms, $\epsilon_{xy}=2$\,px, $\epsilon_t=1$\,ms). The original events (top-left) show dense edge structure on the rotating disc. Predicted events (top-center) form similar patterns shifted slightly in time and polarity-flipped. After cancellation (top-right), most disc events are suppressed, leaving only residual activity concentrated near the rim (phase error region) and scattered background noise.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Qualitative before/after. \textbf{Row 1:} Real (blue), predicted (red), residual (combined). Event counts show large reduction. \textbf{Row 2:} Per-pixel signed-count images. \textbf{Row 3:} Histograms showing reduction in high-count regions. Disc ROI marked (yellow).}

  \label{fig:highpass_panel}
\end{figure}

The seismic (red-blue) per-pixel images (Row 2) clearly show the cancellation effect: high contrast edges in the original (left column) become ``quiet'' in the residual (right column), with only thin annuli near the rim remaining. The combined view (center column) shows successful cancellation appears gray (red and blue cancel), while residual activity remains visible in saturated colors.

The histograms (Row 3) quantify the effect: the original event distribution (left) shows many pixels with high absolute counts ($|count| > 5$), whereas residuals (right) are dominated by low-count pixels, confirming effective suppression of predictable motion events. Median pixel count drops from $\sim 12$ (original) to $\sim 2$ (residual), a 6$\times$ reduction in clutter.

\section{Comparison with Motion Estimation Accuracy}

The cancellation rate depends on the accuracy of the estimated motion parameters $(\hat c,\hat\omega)$. To quantify this dependency, we repeated the cancellation analysis with artificially biased angular velocity estimates. Figure~\ref{fig:bias_sensitivity} shows that cancellation degrades linearly with angular velocity bias $|\Delta\omega|$ for small biases ($|\Delta\omega| < 0.05$\,rad/s), then collapses rapidly for larger biases.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{images/main_results/bias_sensitivity.png}
  \caption{Robustness to motion estimation bias. Cancellation rate (mean across parameter combinations) as a function of angular velocity bias $\Delta\omega$ added to the estimated $\omega$. Shaded region: $\pm 1$ standard deviation. The lightly shaded band highlights the linear regime (approximately $\pm 0.05$\,rad/s), consistent with~\eqref{eq:angvel-error}. At $\Delta\omega \approx 0.05$\,rad/s, cancellation drops below 50\%, showing accurate $\omega$ is critical.}
  \label{fig:bias_sensitivity}
\end{figure}

This sensitivity experiment validates the phase-error model (Chapter~\ref{chap:problem}): the slope of the initial decline in CR($\Delta\omega$) matches the theoretical prediction from~\eqref{eq:angvel-error}, providing confidence that the dominant failure mode is geometric mismatch rather than temporal gating artifacts.

\section{Limitations and Failure Cases}

Cancellation performance degrades in several scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Long horizons:} At $\Delta t > 8$\,ms, phase errors dominate regardless of tolerance choice, limiting practical operating range to $\Delta t \leq 6$\,ms for this rotation rate ($\omega \approx 2$\,rad/s).
\item \textbf{Miscentered rotation:} If the estimated center $\hat c$ is biased by $> 5$\,px, the radius-dependent residual structure shifts, creating systematic cancellation failures near the outer rim. Accurate center estimation via circle fitting (Chapter~\ref{chap:motion}) mitigates this.
\item \textbf{High-speed rotation:} For $\omega > 4$\,rad/s, the phase error per unit $\Delta t$ grows, requiring proportionally shorter horizons or larger tolerances. This creates a speed-bandwidth trade-off.
\item \textbf{Non-circular motion:} When translation or acceleration is non-negligible, the rotation-only model fails, leaving residual structure that deviates from the pure-circular pattern.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:failure_case} illustrates a representative failure case at long horizon ($\Delta t=8$\,ms): cancellation rate drops to $\sim 30\%$, and residual events cluster in a thick annulus near the rim, confirming phase-drift accumulation. This motivates the operating regime recommendation: $\Delta t \leq 4$\,ms for robust cancellation.

\end{figure}

\section{Summary of Results}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Primary result:} Cancellation rates up to 88\% at short horizons ($\Delta t=1--2$\,ms) with optimal tolerances ($\epsilon_{xy}=2--3$\,px, $\epsilon_t \approx 1$\,ms).
\item \textbf{Exponential decay:} Cancellation rate follows $CR(\Delta t) \propto \exp(-\Delta t / \tau)$ with $\tau_{1/2} \approx 3.5$\,ms, validating phase-error model.
\item \textbf{Spatial targeting:} Strong ROI efficiency ($> 70\%$ gap between inside/outside disc) confirms method targets ego-motion events.
\item \textbf{Operating limits:} Effective range $\Delta t \leq 6$\,ms; optimal $\Delta t = 1--2$\,ms for best cancellation without over-matching.
\item \textbf{Robustness:} Linear sensitivity to angular velocity bias up to $|\Delta\omega| \approx 0.05$\,rad/s; center bias tolerance $\|\Delta c\| < 5$\,px.
\end{itemize}

These results establish quantitative performance bounds for the forward-prediction cancellation approach under rotational ego-motion and provide a foundation for future extensions to general ego-motion models (Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion}).
