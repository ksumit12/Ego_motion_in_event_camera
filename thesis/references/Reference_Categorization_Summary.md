## üéØ **Categorization Rationale**

### **Critical Foundational (01)**
These papers are essential because they:
- Provide the theoretical foundation for predictive coding (Hosoya, Rao)
- Establish core event camera principles (Lichtsteiner)
- Present fundamental motion estimation methods (Gallego papers, Bardow)
- Form the methodological basis for your cancellation approach

### **Highly Relevant (02)**
These papers are important because they:
- Directly address ego-motion estimation with events
- Provide recent advances in event-based SLAM/VO
- Offer hardware and timing considerations
- Present motion compensation techniques for comparison

### **Moderately Relevant (03)**
These papers provide context but are not central because they:
- Focus on depth estimation rather than motion cancellation
- Address global motion rather than per-event prediction
- Cover tracking applications rather than ego-motion suppression

### **Background Context (04)**
These materials support your research by:
- Providing personal notes and reference organization
- Offering additional context and local materials

## üìä **Usage Recommendations**

1. **Start with Critical Foundational papers** for theoretical understanding
2. **Focus on Highly Relevant papers** for methodological insights
3. **Reference Moderately Relevant papers** for broader context
4. **Use Background Context materials** for organization and notes

This categorization ensures efficient navigation of your reference materials based on their importance to your specific research on ego-motion cancellation in event cameras.
